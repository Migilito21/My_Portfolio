                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my Website, I am Miguel Brando A. Monacillo, a student of CITE with the course of Computer Engineering Technology. I have been a student of CITE for 3 years, and I am a graduating student. As an engineering student I strive to broaden my horizons with the complexities of the ever evolving world of technology. As a web developer, I can bring creativity and functionaly together to craft engaging and user-friendly websites.I am still in the process of my inplant training on Sun Asterisk, I will be training under their leaders for 1 year and 3 months. I am dedicated to deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed the user expectations. <br> <br>
                    In addition to my web development knowledge, I have keen eye for quality assurance. I understand the critical importance of ensuring that software and applications not only functions seamlessly but also meet the highest standards of quality. With a careful approach, I can conduct thorough testing, identify potential issues, and collaborate with the development teams to implement effective solutions, contributing to the delivery of a reliable and high-performance software or product. <br> <br>
                    My journey in Computer Engineering has equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, contributing to algorithm design and process, and system architecture. I am encouraged by a continues desire to stay updated with the latest industry and technologies, which helps me to bring an innovative and efficient project output.
