            <p id="journey">During the first month of the training, we had an introduction and an orientation, had a meeting for the new DTS. We setup our local machines with the tools necessary for the work and made an account for github. We got introduced to the different development lifecycle of the projects, had our first scrum meeting and had our first task on the project that they were working on, we were in the QA for the first month and tasked on testing the test cases of the project. </p>

            <p id="journey_p2">We were transferred to the Development Department on the second month to pursue coding and web development. We were under the care the team leaders during this phase. The first few weeks we learned about the different frameworks and got back to learning the basics of javascript. During our learning on udemy courses they also had some quizzes which we answered. For one month we studied on the different frameworks such as ReactJS, NextJS, Typescript, GraphQL, Prisma, and NestJS, also NodeJS.</p>

            <p id="journey_p3">On the third moth of the training we were now introduced to a project in collaboration with the new employees to implement what we’ve learned for the past month. We first setup our local on what frameworks and applications they used. We accomplished a lot of tasks during our training within the span of 2 months with the E-Learning System project but we weren’t able to finish it due to difficult obstacles we weren’t table to accomplish.</p>

            <p id="journey_p4">We were later given another project and this time we started from scratch and we were on our own. We worked on the project for 3 months but ran out of time and we still weren’t able to finish it due to the incoming project placement and the problems that we encountered that we took too long to resolve.</p>

            <p id="journey_p5">On the tenth month of our DTS we were now placed on an actual project and our client is the one and only Sun Asterisk Company. We are tasked with bug fixes, minor code reviews, and improvement tasks. In the present I am still learning and constantly finding new ways to improve myself, and learn what is best to also improve my skills not just technically but also socially.</p>
